## Agile-Workflow Substrate

Work tracked in `.work/` as markdown items with YAML frontmatter
(`kind, stage, tags, parent, depends_on, release_binding`).
Layout: `.work/active/{epics,features,stories}/`, `.work/backlog/`,
`.work/releases/<version>/`, `.work/archive/`.

**Primary query tool:** `.work/bin/work-view` filters by stage, tag, kind,
parent, and dependency. Common patterns:
- `work-view --ready` — items ready to work (deps satisfied)
- `work-view --stage review` — items waiting on user
- `work-view --parent <id>` / `--blocking <id>` — hierarchy / sequencing
- `work-view --help` for the full flag set

Detailed navigation rules in `.claude/rules/agile-workflow.md` (auto-loaded
when editing `.work/` or `docs/`). Foundation docs in `docs/` describe the
system NOW — never add legacy notes; git history is the audit trail.

### Test integrity

When running, writing, or modifying tests:

- **File real production bugs as backlog items.** When a test failure
  surfaces an actual product bug (not a stale fixture, drifted assertion,
  or broken mock), park it via `/agile-workflow:park` instead of silently
  fixing it inline mid-test-pass. The backlog item is the audit trail.
- **Fix bad tests in-session.** Stale fixtures, drifted assertions, broken
  mocks, and outdated snapshots are test debt, not product bugs. Repair
  them as you go so the suite stays meaningful.
- **Then drain small backlog bugs with a full pass.** Once tests are
  green again, if a parked production bug is small enough for a single
  stride, pick it up immediately as `/agile-workflow:scope` → design →
  implement. Larger bugs stay in backlog for prioritization.
- **NEVER game a test to make it pass.** A failing test that documents
  *why* it fails — an inline comment naming the bug, a `skip` linked to a
  backlog id, an `xfail` with a reason — is more honest than a green test
  that lies. No `expect(true).toBe(true)`, no asserting on whatever the
  code happens to return, no deleting a test as "flaky" without
  root-causing first.

Slash commands (user-invokable):

`/agile-workflow:autopilot`, `/agile-workflow:release-deploy`.

## UI/UX Design Convention

**Mockup-first.** All UI/UX design is done as standalone HTML/CSS/JS mockups
before any production code is written. Mockups are committed.

**Location.** Mockups live in `.mockups/` with three buckets:

- `.mockups/design-system/` — palette, typography, tokens (project-wide)
- `.mockups/screens/<feature-id>/` — single-screen options per feature
- `.mockups/flows/<flow-name>/` — multi-page user journeys

`<feature-id>` matches the agile-workflow item id when applicable, else a
kebab-case short name.

**Process.**
- Single screen with options to align on: `/ux-ui-design:screens`
- Multi-page user flow for sign-off: `/ux-ui-design:flows`
- Palette / typography / design tokens: `/ux-ui-design:palette`
- Convention reference (auto-loads): `/ux-ui-design:ux-ui-principles`

**Tech rule.** Single-file HTML per mock, vanilla CSS in `<style>`, vanilla JS
in `<script>`. No build step, no CSS framework CDNs. Hosted fonts (Google
Fonts, etc.) are fine when the palette specifies one.

**Linking.** Each substrate item with mocks gets a `## Mockups` section in its
body pointing at the relevant `.mockups/` paths.

**Skip mocking** for trivial copy changes, bug fixes that don't shift visual
structure, behind-the-scenes refactors, or feature-level UI that cleanly
reuses existing components and patterns. Mock new surfaces, design-system
shifts, and multi-screen epics.

## Commit discipline

Always use `git add <explicit-path>` for every file. Never use `git add .`,
`git add -A`, or `git commit -a` — these sweep untracked files into unrelated
commits and have caused real noise in commit history (see story
`posttooluse-hook-over-stages-untracked-files`). This applies to all agents,
sub-agents, and orchestrators: stage only the files your current task touched.
