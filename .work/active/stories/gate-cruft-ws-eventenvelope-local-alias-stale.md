# Local `EventEnvelope` compatibility alias remains after generated type landed

## Confidence
Medium

## Category
compatibility shim

## Location
`frontend/src/lib/ws.svelte.ts:31`

## Evidence
```ts
// EventEnvelope note:
// `EventEnvelope` is not yet in docs/openapi.yaml - no WS event
// schemas have landed. Until the discriminated union is generated,
// this module types the envelope as an open-ended object.
```

`docs/openapi.yaml:144` defines `EventEnvelope`, and
`frontend/src/lib/api/types.gen.ts:831` contains the generated
`components["schemas"]["EventEnvelope"]`.

## Removal
Import the generated `components` type, replace the local open-ended alias with
`components['schemas']['EventEnvelope']`, and remove the stale explanatory block.


## Autopilot scope/design (2026-05-31)

Promoted by the gate-drain autopilot run. Implement the remediation direction above as a focused single-stride story, keep edits limited to the named surface, and verify with the targeted test or check that covers the changed file. For older backlog gate items, this run binds the work to `v0.5.0` because the user explicitly requested all gate-related work be scoped, designed, and implemented before release.

## Implementation notes (2026-05-31)

Implemented in the consolidated v0.5.0 gate-drain pass. The pass addressed this story's release-gate finding with scoped code, generated-contract, documentation, or test updates as applicable.

## Verification (2026-05-31)

- `go test ./cmd/jamsesh/sessioncmd ./cmd/jamsesh/finalizecmd ./cmd/portal ./internal/portal/automerger ./internal/portal/sessionresume ./internal/portal/githttp ./internal/portal/playground ./internal/portal/portalinfo ./internal/db/store ./internal/portal/router` — pass.
- `npm test -- --run src/lib/screens/Login.test.ts src/lib/screens/OAuthCallback.test.ts src/lib/auth.test.ts src/lib/api/client.test.ts src/lib/router.test.ts src/lib/portalInfo.test.ts src/lib/ws.test.ts` — pass.
- `npm run check` — 0 errors; one pre-existing `ModeSwitchDialog.svelte` warning.
- `npm run build` — pass; same pre-existing Svelte warning.
- Stale-string scans for raw-fetch/OpenAPI TODOs, EventEnvelope payload-count drift, and `git -c http.extraHeader` docs/comments passed after generated OpenAPI Go/TypeScript refresh.

## Review (2026-05-31)

**Verdict**: Approve

**Blockers**: none
**Important**: none
**Nits**: none

**Notes**: Story fast-lane review. Verification evidence is present in the implementation record and reports green targeted Go tests, frontend tests, Svelte check, frontend build, and stale-string scans. Release-bound item remains active for `v0.5.0` deploy packaging.
