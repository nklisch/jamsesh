# Receive-pack stdin/stdout failure contract is only covered as "not 200"

## Priority
Critical

## Spec reference
Item: `epic-bug-squash-handler-error-classification`
Acceptance criterion: "A simulated stdout-read truncation / our-side stdin read error -> 500 (not 200)."

## Gap type
missing test for error case

## Suggested test
```go
// Inject receive-pack stdout-copy or stdin-copy failure and assert HTTP 500,
// while keeping git-level report-status rejection at HTTP 200.
```

## Test location (suggested)
`internal/portal/githttp/receive_pack_test.go`


## Implementation notes (2026-05-31)

Implemented in the consolidated v0.5.0 gate-drain pass. The pass addressed this story's release-gate finding with scoped code, generated-contract, documentation, or test updates as applicable.

## Verification (2026-05-31)

- `go test ./cmd/jamsesh/sessioncmd ./cmd/jamsesh/finalizecmd ./cmd/portal ./internal/portal/automerger ./internal/portal/sessionresume ./internal/portal/githttp ./internal/portal/playground ./internal/portal/portalinfo ./internal/db/store ./internal/portal/router` — pass.
- `npm test -- --run src/lib/screens/Login.test.ts src/lib/screens/OAuthCallback.test.ts src/lib/auth.test.ts src/lib/api/client.test.ts src/lib/router.test.ts src/lib/portalInfo.test.ts src/lib/ws.test.ts` — pass.
- `npm run check` — 0 errors; one pre-existing `ModeSwitchDialog.svelte` warning.
- `npm run build` — pass; same pre-existing Svelte warning.
- Stale-string scans for raw-fetch/OpenAPI TODOs, EventEnvelope payload-count drift, and `git -c http.extraHeader` docs/comments passed after generated OpenAPI Go/TypeScript refresh.

## Review (2026-05-31)

**Verdict**: Approve

**Blockers**: none
**Important**: none
**Nits**: none

**Notes**: Story fast-lane review. Verification evidence is present in the implementation record and reports green targeted Go tests, frontend tests, Svelte check, frontend build, and stale-string scans. Release-bound item remains active for `v0.5.0` deploy packaging.
