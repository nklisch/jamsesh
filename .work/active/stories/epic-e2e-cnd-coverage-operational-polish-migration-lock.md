# Migration concurrent-startup advisory lock coverage — failure

## Scope

One failure-mode test that starts 3 portal containers simultaneously
against a fresh per-test Postgres DB. Verifies the advisory-lock
serialization (`pg_advisory_lock(8675309)` per
`internal/db/migrate.go:17`) — exactly one portal runs migrations; the
others wait, then come up healthy.

Two-pronged assertion: (1) container-log inspection counts which pods
emit the migration-applied log line — exactly 1; (2) post-condition
query against `schema_migrations` (or equivalent table; library is
goose-or-similar — pin at impl time) verifies the schema is at a real
version.

## Files

- `tests/e2e/failure/migration_concurrent_startup_test.go`
- Possibly `tests/e2e/fixtures/containerlog/containerlog.go` (extension
  — add a synchronous `Capture` if only `DumpAndTerminate` exists; check
  before extending)

## Acceptance criteria

- [ ] Test starts N=3 portals in parallel via `errgroup.Group`
- [ ] All 3 report `/healthz` 200 (proven by `portal.Start`'s wait)
- [ ] Exactly 1 portal's container logs contain the "applying
      migrations" / "migration applied" log line (exact phrase pinned
      at impl time after a probe-run against a single-portal startup)
- [ ] Post-condition: `SELECT MAX(version) FROM
      <migrations_table>` returns > 0
- [ ] Test fails loudly if 0 OR 2+ portals report applying migrations
      (advisory-lock failure → split-brain on DDL is a real bug)

## Test integrity (from parent epic)

- The exact migration log phrase must be pinned by probing a real
  single-pod startup. Don't guess; read one real log output, then
  write the test.
- Migration table name is library-specific (goose, sqlx-migrate, etc.).
  Identify by reading `internal/db/migrate.go`'s migration library
  imports OR by querying `\dt` against a freshly-migrated DB.
- If the test sees 2+ portals migrating, that's a real Critical bug
  (advisory lock not serializing DDL). Park it, t.Skip with backlog
  id; do NOT loosen the assertion to "at least one".

## Implementation notes

**Pinned log phrase**: `"db migrations applied"`

The portal + goose library do not log migration activity by default
(`goose.NewProvider` is called with no verbose option, defaulting
`verbose=false`). To give the test a reliable log hook, a
`slog.InfoContext(ctx, "db migrations applied", "dialect", ..., "count", ...)`
line was added to `MigrateUp` in `internal/db/migrate.go`, firing only when
`len(results) > 0` (actual DDL ran). An idempotent no-op run is silent — this
is what lets the test distinguish the one migrator pod from the two waiting pods.

In JSON slog format (the default in the e2e image) the phrase appears as:
`{"msg":"db migrations applied",...}`. The test matches on the `msg` substring
using `strings.Contains` without JSON-parsing, which is stable across slog's
key ordering.

**Migrations table**: `goose_db_version`

Confirmed by: (1) `internal/db/migrate.go` imports `github.com/pressly/goose/v3`
and calls `goose.NewProvider`; (2) the inline comment in `MigrateUp` states
"goose tracks applied versions in the goose_db_version table"; (3) the
post-condition query targets `goose_db_version WHERE is_applied = true` to
avoid counting rollback rows.

**`Logs()` method on `*Portal`**: added to
`tests/e2e/fixtures/portal/portal.go`. Reads the full container log stream via
`testcontainers.Container.Logs(ctx)` and returns it as a string. The existing
`containerlog.DumpAndTerminate` is for failure-mode dumps; `Logs()` is for
explicit, test-initiated inspection.

**Parallel startup**: `errgroup.Group` — no Testcontainers ordering issues
observed. `portal.Start` calls `t.Fatalf` on container failure, which
terminates the goroutine, so `g.Wait()` always returns nil when all portals
start successfully.
